# Host-specific configuration for hostname: x1-cl4p-tp
# This file overrides group defaults and category fallbacks.
# Priority: host_vars/<hostname>.yml > host_vars/<category>.yml > group_vars/all.yml

# Set the category for this host (used as fallback)
host_category: laptop

# If you want to fully control which roles run on this host,
# uncomment and set `default_roles` below. Otherwise this host
# will inherit defaults from `laptop.yml.example` (or `laptop.yml`).

# default_roles:
#   - system
#   - alacritty
#   - auto-cpufreq
#   - btop
#   - fonts
#   - git
#   - lsd
#   - obsidian
#   - vs-code

# Example host-specific overrides
# display:
#   scaling: 1.25
#   night_light: true

# power:
#   suspend_timeout: 10
#   lid_close_action: "suspend"

# Notes:
# - Keep secrets out of this file. Use LastPass references if needed.
# - Customize any variable that is used by roles (see role docs).
